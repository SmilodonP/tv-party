        so all good things come to an end. For three years in a row, Peter Jackson
        has banished our winter blues with the individual instalments of his Tolkien
        trilogy, effectively shifting the focus of our cinematic excitement from the
        summer months to the end of the year. But now that his epic has been unveiled
        in its entirety, what will be the lasting effects of his achievement?\r\n\r\nWell,
        grand-scale fantasy filmmaking is back on the menu, laying down the gauntlet
        to George Lucas and Star Wars Episode III. Jackson has also proved that notions
        of risk and ambition needn''t be confined to the low-budget, indie end of
        the spectrum; nor does California have an exclusive stranglehold on groundbreaking
        special effects.\r\n\r\nAnd then there''s the DVD factor. Just as The Lord
        Of The Rings was upping the stakes in theatres, so too was its DVD release
        pattern defining what can (and should) be done on disc for major movies.\r\n\r\nIn
        particular, the four-disc extended editions seem to have affected the director''s
        thinking as to what he can get away with in his theatrical final cut. Hence
        the public grumbles from Christopher Lee about the non-appearance of Saruman
        in this final instalment. While it might have been fair to grant Lee a curtain
        call, Jackson quite rightly realises that it is Sauron, not Saruman, whose
        fiery eye encompasses all the narrative strands of the climax.\r\n\r\nThe
        Return Of The King marks the first time in the series when Jackson''s roots
        as a horror filmmaker creep through. As the orcs catapult severed Gondorian
        heads beyond the walls of Minas Tirith, flesh-rotted ghosts draw swords alongside
        Aragorn and giant spider Shelob stalks Frodo through dark, web-shrouded tunnels,
        the film pushes the boundaries of its 12A certificate.\r\n\r\nAnd so it should,
        because the look and tone must necessarily grow darker as the Hobbits near
        Mount Doom and Mordor''s evil hand grips Middle-earth ever tighter.\r\n\r\nCharacter
        nuances have been crafted over an unprecedented ten hours-plus of cinematic
        storytelling: from Strider lurking in the shadowy corner to Aragorn rallying
        the troops; from Merry and Pippin as bumbling fools to stout-hearted, pint-sized
        warriors. Only Legolas and Gimli seem to have regressed (in screen time at
        least) to set-piece archer and comedy sidekick respectively. At least Andy
        Serkis is rewarded for his Gollum voice work with an early flashback that
        gets his face on screen, as well as warning us that, under the ring''s power,
        Smeagol can be as murderous as Gollum.\r\n\r\nJackson has kept the momentum
        of the series rolling on and on though the traditionally ''difficult'' middle
        part and ''weak'' finale, delivering a climax to the story that''s neater
        and more affecting than what Tolkien managed on the printed page. Some viewers
        might feel that the director sprinkles some cheese on his extended coda, adding
        at least one false ending too many (even if he does ignore the book''s Scouring
        of The Shire).\r\n\r\nBut those who have walked beside these heroes every
        step of the way on such a long journey deserve the emotional pay-off as well
        as the action peaks, and they will be genuinely touched as the final credits
        roll. Yes, the Ring is dead. Long live King Kong.\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdict - The
        resounding climax to a landmark in cinema history. But the King has now returned,
        the story is over and the ships are leaving Middle-earth. Ladies and gentlemen,
        Elvish has left the building.\r\n\r\n5/5\r\n\r\n- Alan Morrison, Empire Magazine","created_at":"2013-07-20

        much CGI, redundancy, clichés and drawn out “looks of love” for my tastes.\r\n\r\nRELEASED
        2003 and directed by Peter Jackson, “The Lord of the Rings: The Return of
        the King” adapts the third part of JRR Tolkien’s popular fantasy trilogy about
        adventures on Middle-Earth: Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Astin) and Gollum
        (Andy Serkis) continue to try to make their way to Mount Doom to destroy the
        One Ring. Meanwhile Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom),
        Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies), Gandalf the wizard (Ian McKellen), King
        Theoden (Bernard Hill) and Faramir (David Wenham) join forces to fight Sauron''s
        army at the stone city of Minas Tirith and, later, draw the forces of Modor
        out as a distraction for Frodo to accomplish his goal. Billy Boyd and Dominic
        Monaghan are on hand as Hobbits Pippin and Merry.        \r\n\r\nWhile I’m
        a casual fantasy/adventure fan and have read numerous books of the genre (e.g.
        Conan, Tarzan, Gor, etc.), I’ve never read Tokien, likely because I’m not
        into Hobbits, Elves and Dwarfs. After viewing the three movies, The Lord of
        the Rings strikes me as a mixture of Robin Hood, Conan and The Wizard of Oz,
        which all possibly influenced Tolkien’s writing of the Rings trilogy in 1937-1949.
        So, if you think a meshing of “Conan the Barbarian” (1982) and “Robin Hood:
        Prince of Thieves” (1991) with “The Wizard of Oz” (1939) sounds good, then
        you’ll probably like these movies more than me. \r\n\r\n“The Return of the
        King” is just more of the same showcased in the first two movies, but even
        LONGER. Take the Battle of Minas Tirith, for example. It’s basically the same
        as The Battle at Helms Deep in the previous movie, except with colossal elephant-like
        creatures and the Army of the Dead. These two battles are similar enough that
        they could’ve been condensed into one conflict. Speaking of the Army of the
        Dead, this was an interesting new element, as was the horrifying spider-monster
        that Frodo & Sam face inside the caves.   \r\n\r\nLike the first two movies,
        the characters are diverse, the tale is creative, there’s a lot of dark action
        rounded out by softer scenes and everything LOOKS and SOUNDS magnificent.
        Unfortunately, as with “The Two Towers,” there’s excessive use of CGI (aka
        CGI porn). If cartoony CGI is your thang then you’ll likely appreciate this
        installment more than me.        \r\n\r\nThere are other problems: While the
        characters are inspired, they’re also thin and rather uninteresting, at least
        for mature people who require more depth to hold their attention. Take Legolas
        (Bloom), for example; we never get to know him. Or consider Aragorn: Mortensen
        is perfect as the noble warrior, but in the ENTIRE trilogy he probably only
        has like two full pages of dialog, maybe three. Also, I found the story generally
        disengaging. I was never much enthralled by the characters and their pursuits,
        although devotees of Tolkien might be. \r\n\r\nThen there are WAY too many
        “looks of love” between characters, particularly Frodo and Sam (I was so happy
        to see one character get married and have kids, if you catch my drift). There’s
        also a sense of redundancy, like the aforementioned battles (Helms Deep and
        Minas Tirith). Or consider the hokey dangling from a cliff by one’s fingers:
        This was already done with Gandalf at the end of the first part and beginning
        of the next. Did we really need the entire trilogy to come down to this type
        of eye-rolling cliché?    \r\n\r\nAnother problem is the lack of feminine
        protagonists. There’s Miranda Otto as Éowyn, Théoden''s niece, who becomes
        infatuated with Aragorn and masquerades as a warrior-ess. Other than that
        all we have are cameos by Liv Tyler (Arwen), Cate Blanchett (Galadriel) and
        a Hobbit’s wife. “Mythica: A Quest for Heroes” (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000
        to make, which is a mere fraction of the $94 million it cost to make this
        blockbuster and the creators knew enough to throw in a couple of prominent
        babes as heroines in the story. So did “Conan the Barbarian” and “Dungeons
        & Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God” (2005). It’s not rocket science. \r\n\r\nAs
        noted above, the movie’s needlessly overlong and things could’ve been condensed
        in the trilogy or omitted altogether. When the main storyline ultimately ends
        at Mount Doom I was thinking there was maybe 12-15 minutes left with half
        of that time being credits. Nope, there was STILL 30 MINUTES LEFT wherein
        boring goodbyes and “looks of love” are tacked on. \r\n\r\nDespite these honest
        quibbles, “The Return of the King,” and the trilogy in general, was an ultra-ambitious
        undertaking and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados, particularly
        those who favor Tolkien, Hobbits, Elves, Gnomes and the like.                      \r\n\r\nTHE
        MOVIE RUNS 3 hours 21 minutes and was shot in New Zealand.  \r\n\r\nGRADE:

        outstanding end to the trilogy.\r\n\r\nI expected a lot from <em>''The Lord
        of the Rings: The Return of the King''</em> so I am delighted to see it produce
        on so many levels. I, funnily enough, wouldn''t actually say it''s necessarily
        the most perfect execution - what with the plot coincidences and extreme character
        armour. But that doesn''t matter one jot whatsoever, as the story wraps up
        in arguably the best way - at least to watch - possible. It has so much heart
        and feeling to it.\r\n\r\nThe story involving the characters of Elijah Wood,
        Sean Astin and Andy Serkis remained the most interesting to me, I was very
        satisfied with how it concluded in regards to them. I also enjoyed the bits
        we got of Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen & Co. All that added to the beautiful
        look and creation of the film, with the world coming alive splendidly.\r\n\r\nIf
        I were to nit-pick further, I would say the run time is slightly too long.
        The pacing is absolutely fine, very good in fact, but I coulda done without
        a few of the many end scenes - a lot of which are necessary and welcome, but
        a couple could''ve been left out to allow the viewer to imagine how the world
        continued. That''s just how I feel mind, I''m sure I''m one of only a few
        that think that way.\r\n\r\nBack onto the positives: how about those battle
        sequences? Astonishingly good. A sensational trilogy, no question about it.
        I look forward to seeing <em>''The Hobbit''</em> films.","created_at":"2021-02-19

        an avid fan of Tolkien''s The Lord of the Rings from long before New Line
        announced this movie \"trilogy,\" I must say all three films were fairly large
        disappointments.  Now, mind you, I am not your usual, \"The book is better\"
        movie reviewer.  But it is almost like Peter Jackson went out of his way to
        take out the most crucial elements of the books and replace it with drivel.  Also
        every line that sounds even remotely cool in the books must be given to Gandalf,
        no matter who actually said it...  That''s just frustrating, despite Sir Ian
        McKellen''s stellar performance.  With what I would hope is the obvious exception
        of Orlando Bloom''s third dismal performance as Legolas, the actors all did
        quite well; the characters were just not allowed to shine as they do in the
        books.\r\n\r\nI see that the common consensus is that this movie is too long,
        and I agree.  What''s most frustrating about that to me is that this movie
        had to finish The Two Towers since that film did not complete, and then this
        film left out the pivotal ending of the saga.  The Return of the King is actually
        the shortest volume of the three (there are six books, two in each volume).  As
        some have noted, the film noticeably scraps the scouring of the Shire, but
        for those who might have hoped for a fourth installment to finish that story,
        Peter Jackson dashed all hopes by disturbingly killing off Saruman at the
        beginning of the extended edition.  By the by, I understand many people feel
        that the scouring of the Shire is anticlimactic after the final defeat of
        Sauron, but for myself, I think the point that there is still evil in the
        world, and that heroes must still rise to fight it, is one of Tolkien''s triumphs.  Back
        to my main point, though: the books were shorter while telling more story,
        because despite his depth and detail, Tolkien understood how to drive  a story
        along.  Peter Jackson, on the other hand, fails on that count.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
        I am someone who always hoped that these movies would be made (I grew up watching
        the animations produced by Rankin/Bass and Fantasy Films).  But now I suppose
        I''ll have to wait until someone is daring enough to try again, despite the
        overwhelming success of these films (which will probably not happen in my
        lifetime).  In the meantime, I''ll continue to read the books every year.","created_at":"2021-11-16

        just seen this on the big screen for the first time since I saw it at London''s
        sadly now long-gone Odeon at Marble Arch, which - at the time - boasted the
        biggest screen in the UK, and it has lost little of it''s magic. Continuing
        with the interwoven tales of \"Frodo\", \"Sam\" and their treacherous guide
        \"Gollum\" as they trek through fire and brimstone to get the ring to Mount
        Doom; whilst Gandalf, Aragorn and the surviving members of the fellowship
        try to stem the might of \"Sauron\" and his armies of orcs and their allies.
        While this is undoubtedly a magnificent piece of cinema, I find the story
        drags a bit. I found the the focus to be too much on the less interesting
        characters - the lovelorn \"Eowyn\" (Miranda Otto); the delusional \"Denethor\"
        (John Noble) and decent but rather wimpish \"Faramir\" (David Wenham) as \"Gondor\"
        faces the wrath of their nemesis, and that slows the pace from the action
        just when it ought to be building. The delightful, friendly, rivalry between
        \"Gimli\" & \"Legolas\" features all too sparingly and it''s got too ponderous
        a narrative to sustain the four hours the otherwise visionary Peter Jackson
        has created. Fortunately, the triple-header quest with Elijah Wood, Sean Astin
        and a superb Andy Serkis keep the other strand moving along suspensefully
        and tensely. The battle scenes are superb, though - when we get them, the
        effects really do rise to the occasion and, of course, the striking cinematography
        coupled with the inspired themes from Howard Shore contribute to a thoroughly
        entertaining adaptation of a thoroughly captivating fantasy adventure. If
        you make it past the start of the credits, there is the gloriously haunting
        \"Into the West\" from Annie Lennox to top off this finest of trilogies. The
        Oscar/BAFTA awards this achieved are a just reward for years of stunningly
        creative effort from thousands of people who turned the imagination of a 20th
        Century English academic into films that will last forever.","created_at":"2023-09-03
